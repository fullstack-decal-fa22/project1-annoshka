            <p>
                International Rescue Committeee has been my favorite internship, as I was able to help support refugees that were coming 
                from the Middle East and Russia at that time. I helped translating, completeing immigration documents, picking up and dropping 
                off clients, and doing cultural orientations for refugees. If you would like to learn more about IRC, please click on
